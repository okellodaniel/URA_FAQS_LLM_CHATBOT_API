It can be provided by the associate of the employer or can be provided to an associate of the employee.A benefit is said to have been obtained in respect of employment:When it is provided by an employer or by a third party under arrangement with the employer or an associate of the employerWhen it is provided to an employee or an associate of an employeeWhen it is provided in respect of past, present or prospective employmentThe valuation of benefits for the purposes of subsection (3) of section 19 of the Act is determined as follows.Where a benefit provided by an employer to an employee consists of the use or availability for use, of a motor vehicle wholly or partly for the private purposes of the employee, the value of the benefit is calculated according to the following formula –(20%x A x B/C) – D where,A. Is the market value of the motor vehicle at the time when it was first provided for the private use of the employee;B. Is the number of days in the year of income on which the motor vehicle was used or available for use for private purposes by the employee for all or a part of the day;C. Is the number of days in the year of income;D. Is any payment made by the employee for the benefit.Where a benefit provided by an employer to an employee consists of the provision of a housekeeper, chauffeur, gardener, or other domestic assistant, the value of the benefit is the total employment income paid to the domestic assistant in respect of services rendered to the employee, reduced by any payment made by the employee for the benefit. However provision of a security private guard is not classified as a taxable benefitFor example if the company pays a gardener sh. 150,000 per month, but the employee contributes sh. 20,000 per month, the benefit derived by the employee is sh. 130,000 (i.e.150,000 – 20,000). If the employee does not contribute anything, the benefit is sh. 150,000.Where a benefit provided by an employer to an employee consists of the provision of any meal, refreshment, or entertainment, the value of the benefit is the cost to the employer of providing the meal, refreshment, or entertainment, reduced by any consideration paid by the employee for the meal, refreshment, or entertainment. For example if the meals are provided for 26 days in a month, each meal costing3,000 and the employee not contributing anything, then the benefit is sh.78,000 per month (3,000 x 26).Where a benefit provided by an employer to an employee consists of the Provision of utilities in respect of the employee’s place of residence, the value of the benefit is the cost to the employer of providing the utilities reduced by any consideration paid by theemployee for the utilities.In this case, the actual payment receipts from the utility company can be used to ascertain thevalue (less actual contribution by the employee if any).Where a benefit provided by an employer to an employee consists of a loan, or loans in total, exceeding one million shillings at a rate of interest below the statutory rate, the value of the benefit is the difference between the interest paid during the year of income, if any, and the interest which would have been paid if the loan had been made at the statutory rate for the year of income. Statutory rate here refers to the Bank of Uganda discount rate at the commencement of the year of income. Example: if an employer gives an employee a school fees loan of sh.400,000;a furniture loan of sh. 500,000 and an appliances loan of sh. 300,000 at 10% interest per month when the statutory rate is 15%, the benefit would be sh. 60,000 ( i.e. 1,200,000 x 15%) – (1,200,000 x10%) = 180,000 – 120,000.Where a benefit provided by an employer to an employee consists of the waiver by an employer of an obligation of the employee to pay or repay an amount owing to the employer or to any other person, the value of the benefit is the amount waived. Example: In the month of January 2015, an employee owed a bank sh. 300,000 . The employer decided to pay the full amount for the employee on 31st January 2015 and opted not to recover that amount from the employee. The employee has obtained a benefit equal to sh. 300,000 for the month of January, which should be part of her employment income.Where a benefit provided by an employer to an employee consists of the transfer or use of property or the provision of services, the value of the benefit is the market value of the property or services at the time the benefit is provided, reduced by any payment made by the employee for the benefit. Example: The Company transferred a car valued at sh. 5,000,000 to an employee in February 2014. The employee was asked to contribute sh. 1 ,000,000 for that car. The employee derived a benefit equal to sh. 4 million in February, which should be included in his employment income.Where a benefit provided by an employer to an employee consists of the provision of accommodation or housing in kind, the value of the benefit is the lesser of:1. the market rent of the accommodation or housing reduced by any payment made by the employee for the benefit; or2. Fifteen per cent of the employment income, including the amount referred to in paragraph (a), paid by the employer to the employee for the year of income in which the accommodation or housing was provided.a. the market rent of the accommodation or housing reduced by any payment made by the employee for the benefit; orb. Fifteen per cent of the employment income, including the amount referred to in paragraph (a), paid by the employer to the employee for the year of income in which the accommodation or housing was provided Example: A company pays an employee basic salary sh. 3,000,000 per month; transport allowance sh. 300,000 per month and medical allowance sh. 200,000per month. They provided him with a company house whose market rent is sh. 600,000 per month for which he contributes 50,000 per month. The benefit derived by this employee is the lesser of:a) (600,000 – 50,000) = 550,000 andb) 15% (3,000,000 + 300,000 + 200,000 + 550,000) = 607,500 In this case the housing benefit is sh. 550,000',\n",

       "  'answer': 'There are six international methods for valuing imported goods stipulated in the World Trade Organization Agreement on Customs Valuation. These methods are applied in sequential order.The primary method of valuation is thetransaction value method, which is the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the country of importation. A number of conditions must be met to use the transaction valuation method and it can involve deductions or additions such as commissions or royalties.When the transaction value cannot be used, one of the alternative methods will be used to determine the customs value (methods of valuation) in sequential orderTransaction value of identical goods value method– This considers the transaction value of Identical goods previously cleared through Customs. Identical goods mean goods that are same in all aspect except minor difference such as color or size. These goods must be of the same brand and country of export.Transaction value of similar goods value method– This considers the transaction value of similar goods previously cleared through Customs. Similar goods are goods that have like characteristics and are commercially interchangeable; if a customer doesn’t find the exact product he/she wanted can choose an alternative e.g. Colgate and Close up. For goods to be regarded as similar, the brand must be of the same reputation e.g. LG and Samsung; and from the same country of export.Deductive value method–The basis for the Customs value is the price at which the greatest aggregate quantity of the imported goods is sold in Uganda. Post importation costs and taxes are deducted to arrive at the Customs value.The deductible costs include:o Taxes such as VAT, Import Duty, Excise Dutyo Profits and general expenses e.g. rent, labour, etc; associated to the distribution and sale of the goodso Post importation costs associated with the logistics and transportation of the goods to the bonded warehouse.Computed value method– This is based on the direct cost of producing the goods like raw materials, consumables, general expenses, other costs and profits relating to the production and sale of the imported goods. This method requires to get information for the country of production.Fall-back value– where no other methods are suitable, the customs value can be derived based on one of the five methods reasonably adjusted. The method is not used on its own but relies on the sequential flexible interpretation of the 1st to the 5th method until the value of the goods is determined.Customs will determine the value by considering the above valuation methods and any other relevant information.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Cargo consolidation, also known as cargo groupage, refers to the process of combining and bundling multiple small shipments (cargo) from different shippers, consignees, or traders from the same country of export and purchase into a single larger shipment or container heading to the same destination, country, or point of final customs clearance.Each of the individual shipments or cargo bundles is entitled to a House Bill of Lading indicating the true actual owner, cargo description, quantity, and weight of the cargo bundle or shipment. This individual House Bill of Lading is the title of ownership that a formal consolidator awards each individual shipment cargo bundle to prove a shipper, trader, and customer’s ownership of that specific cargo. It is also the first document that enables the shipper, trader, or consignee to process their final tax clearances under the acceptable customs clearance procedure and take possession of their cargo',\n",

These details ought to appear on the Master Bill of Lading (MBL) and the House Bill of Lading (HBL).Cargo is weighed, marked, and bundled with other smaller cargo belonging to different traders but destined for the same final destination and customs clearance point.The consolidator ensures that before the goods arrive at the first port of entry, for instance, Mombasa/Dar-es-Salaam, all individual importers in the container have been identified; TIN details indicated on the Master Bill of Lading and have submitted the required purchase documentation, i.e., invoices, evidence of payments, parking lists with a detailed description of goods, quantities, delivery notes, etc.When goods arrive at the first port of entry in the partner state (e.g., Mombasa, Dar-es-Salaam), transit entries are captured to move the goods to the destination bond in Uganda, where final clearance will take place. These customs documents are called WT8 and T1.When the container arrives at the Inland Container Depot (ICD) or bond, the bond operator and customs officer receive the cargo. WT8/T1 entries are auto-converted to the warehousing entry (IM7). The registered consolidator and the appointed agent handle cargo examinations with customs and upload examination accounts for further processing.The consolidator then initiates a transfer of ownership from his names to the individual taxpayers they consolidated (breaks bulk). Transfer of ownership fees are paid, and approval of the transfer is done by the Supervisor customs.All individual importers are required to appoint their own licensed customs agents to take on the process of clearing the items after the consolidator has approved the transfer of ownership.The individual importers have the option to pay taxes after transfer of ownership approval or continue with the warehousing process as per the warehousing procedures or goods are re-exported.
